# Data Scientist | AI Engineer

### Education
Computer Science & Data Science @ Ateneo de Manila University (2018-2022)

### Work Experience
Data Scientist @ IBM
- Generative AI: Developing proof-of-concepts (POCs) to demonstrate potential of generative AI in solving specific business problems for various tasks such as summarization, inference, and others.
- Large Language Models (LLMs): Optimizing LLM performance through prompt engineering techniques and retrieval augmented generation, achieving significant performance improvements in accuracy and relevance.

Junior Data Scientist @ Kumu
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Collected data from distributed data processing via Spark, and analyzed data by applying PCA, and pre-processing techniques such as checking for multicollinearity/segmentation - promoting streamer discovery using second-degree connections.
- Model Development: Built a recommendation engine using collaborative filtering and deployed the model on Kubernetes.
- Experimentation: Applied A/B test framework to 100k users.

### Projects
LLM-Driven Sales Analytics
- Developed a successful proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrating the potential of large language models (LLMs) to generate data-driven sales insights, potentially reducing the time sales leaders spend analyzing sales data by up to 50%.
